I'm Max and this is my blog about software engineering (mostly). I'm in the Washington, D.C. region and work on brain-computer interfaces for [Blackrock Neurotech][BR]. My past work includes software development for bioinformatics research, cloud infrastructure security, cyberstorage, and augmented reality applications.

* My public projects are at [github.com/mxk][GH].
* I'm not on LinkedIn or any other social media websites, and I have never been the CEO of Lukoil :wink:

I am a pilot, skydiver, and senior parachute rigger. I love everything aviation. I also enjoy rock climbing, running, biking, hiking, and I'm in the process of getting my scuba open water certification. My favorite reading is classic Russian literature, and topics related to technology, psychology, and physics.
