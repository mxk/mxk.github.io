		<p>A few days of being sick with COVID-19 at the end of April 2022 allowed me to finish reading <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Deep Work by Cal Newport</a>. It is one of the most important books I have read in the last few years. Beyond just learning something new, it provided the justification and the motivation that I needed to start taking concrete steps toward having more depth in my work. This blog is one such step.</p>
<p>Throughout high school and college, I created&mdash;and quickly abandoned&mdash;blogs, websites, and phpBB forums. I participated in various mailing lists and generally found fulfillment in the free exchange of knowledge. Over the last 15 years or so, I began treating the internet more and more as a read-only resource. After all, what can I say that is genuinely useful or interesting, won&rsquo;t get lost in all the noise, and hasn&rsquo;t been said hundreds of times already on Hacker News, Slashdot, Reddit, and other sites? I&rsquo;m trying not to care about that anymore. This blog is for me&mdash;to help me focus on work that is meaningful.</p>
<p>After graduating from UMD in 2008 with a degree in computer science, I joined a bioinformatics research institute where I stayed for almost 10 years. The work was interesting, I enjoyed the collaborations we had, I was learning a lot, I got to publish papers, and I made contributions that lead to patents and awards. I loved that environment and I&rsquo;m grateful to the people who enabled it. But I started getting too comfortable and felt like I was stagnating as a software engineer. I interviewed with Google in 2014, but had reservations about both the company and moving to California. Finally, in 2017, I left for my first tech startup. As of two weeks ago, I am now on my fourth.</p>
<p>In thinking about the differences between my research and startup work, depth seems to be the main distinguishing factor. Although I have learned more in my five-year startup journey in terms of technologies, languages, and best practices, I have significantly fewer external accomplishments to show for it. That&rsquo;s disappointing, especially considering that the pace of the work was so much faster. Of course, not all startups are the same, but for me, the culture of &ldquo;fake it till you make it,&rdquo; open office environments, endless meetings, Jira, and a focus on quickly building MVPs and demos at the expense of well-thought-out long-term solutions, all consumed years with little value in the end. I&rsquo;m still glad to have had this experience.</p>
<p>Depth yielded joy in my early programming adventures, going all the way back to my teenage years. Reading Deep Work reminded me how I used to be able to read Intel&rsquo;s Software Developer Manuals and write my own x86 boot loaders just for fun without my mind demanding regular fixes of shallow distraction. The experience is best described in the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow">Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a>, which I read at the start of the pandemic, but understanding the components of flow was insufficient to reliably reproduce the state. As I start my new job, I hope to establish some new habits in an effort to re-discover what I once loved about creating new things.</p>
